Typically growing to 60–75 cm (24–30 in) tall and wide, it is a bushy, woody-based evergreen perennial, widely grown for the highly decorative variegated leaves found in cultivated varieties. Another common name is painted nettle, reflecting its relationship to deadnettles (Lamium species), which are in the same family. (True nettles and their close kin are in the distant family Urticaceae.) The synonyms Coleus blumei, Plectranthus scutellarioides and Solenostemon scutellarioides are also widely used for this species.","citation":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleus_scutellarioides","license_name":"CC BY-SA 3.0","license_url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/"},"synonyms":["Calchas acuminatus","Calchas atropurpureus","Calchas crispipilus","Calchas scutellarioides","Calchas scutellarioides var. angustifolia","Calchas scutellarioides var. crispipilus","Calchas scutellarioides var. limnophila","Calchas scutellarioides var. scutellarioides","Coleus acuminatus","Coleus atropurpureus","Coleus atropurpureus var. atropurpureus","Coleus atropurpureus var. densiflorus","Coleus atropurpureus var. javanicus","Coleus atropurpureus var. ramosus","Coleus batemannii","Coleus bausei","Coleus berkeleyi","Coleus blancoi","Coleus blumei","Coleus blumei var. blumei","Coleus blumei var. marshallii","Coleus blumei var. murrayi","Coleus blumei var. pectinatus","Coleus blumei var. telfordii","Coleus blumei var. verschaffeltii","Coleus clarkei","Coleus crispipilus","Coleus dixii","Coleus eureka","Coleus formosanus","Coleus gaudichaudii","Coleus gibbsiae","Coleus gibsonii","Coleus grandifolius","Coleus hendersonii","Coleus hybridus","Coleus igolotorum","Coleus ingratus","Coleus integrifolius","Coleus laciniatus","Coleus macranthus","Coleus macranthus var. crispipilus","Coleus marmoratus","Coleus marshallii","Coleus multicolor","Coleus multiflorus","Coleus murrayi","Coleus pubescens","Coleus pumilus","Coleus rehneltianus","Coleus reveesii","Coleus ruckeri","Coleus saundersiae","Coleus saundersii","Coleus savannicola","Coleus scottii","Coleus scutellarioides var. angustifolius","Coleus scutellarioides var. blumei","Coleus scutellarioides var. celebicus","Coleus scutellarioides var. crispipilus","Coleus scutellarioides var. gibbsiae","Coleus scutellarioides var. gracilis","Coleus scutellarioides var. grandifolius","Coleus scutellarioides var. ingratus","Coleus scutellarioides var. integrifolius","Coleus scutellarioides var. laciniatus","Coleus scutellarioides var. laxus","Coleus scutellarioides var. limnophilus","Coleus scutellarioides var. scutellarioides","Coleus secundiflorus","Coleus telfordii","Coleus veitchii","Coleus verschaffeltii","Coleus verschaffeltii var. marmoratus","Coleus verschaffeltii var. splendens","Coleus verschaffeltii var. verschaffeltii","Coleus wilsonii","Coleus zschokkei","Germanea nudiflora","Majana acuminata","Majana blancoi","Majana grandifolia","Majana multiflora","Majana pumila","Majana scutellariodes","Majana scutellarioides","Majana scutellarioides var. atropurpureus","Majana scutellarioides var. blumei","Majana scutellarioides var. scutellarioides","Majana secundiflora","Ocimum peltatum","Ocimum scutellarioides","Perilla nankinensis","Plectranthus aromaticus","Plectranthus blumei","Plectranthus ingratus","Plectranthus laciniatus","Plectranthus merrillii","Plectranthus nudiflorus","Plectranthus scutellarioides","Polypodium ovatum","Solenostemon blumei","Solenostemon scutellarioides"],"watering":{"max":2,"min":2},"best_light_condition":"This plant thrives in bright, indirect light. It can tolerate some direct sunlight, especially in the morning, but too much can scorch its leaves. If it's grown indoors, placing it near a window with filtered light is ideal. In lower light conditions, the plant may lose some of its vibrant colors and become leggy.","best_soil_type":"For optimal growth, this plant prefers well-draining soil. A mix of potting soil with some added perlite or sand works well to ensure good drainage. It doesn't like heavy, clay soils that retain too much moisture. Adding organic matter like compost can also help improve soil structure and fertility.","best_watering":"Watering this plant properly is crucial for its health. It prefers consistently moist soil but doesn't like to sit in water. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's important to let the top inch of soil dry out between waterings. During the growing season, you might need to water it more frequently, especially if it's in a pot. In the winter, reduce watering as the plant's growth slows down.","language":"en","entity_id":"65d089927cc2dceb"}}],"diseases":[{"id":"53aac959aba8302b","name":"mechanical damage","probability":0.1215,"details":{"description":"Mechanical damage occurs when parts of the plant are disrupted by physical action, usually by tools or inappropriate handling.
